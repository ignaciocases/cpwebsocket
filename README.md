CPWebSocket
===========

A WebSocket implementation for Cappuccino.

Test it out by running runserver.js from
[node.websocket](http://github.com/shazow/node.websocket.js) (with
[Node](http://github.com/ry/node)) and then browsing to
TestHarness/index.html with a browser that supports WebSockets (such
as Google Chrome).
